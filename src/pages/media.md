In addition to being a guest on a range of design & tech podcasts, I'm a radio news anchor at KBOO-FM, a community radio station in Portland and serve as a regular contributor on Iain Alba's english language Finnish baseball podcast [Superpesis Roundup.](https://superpesisroundup.wordpress.com/) Previously, I was a board member and news anchor at WFHB in Bloomington, Indiana. 

If we meet at a party sometime, you can ask me the story of setting up a college internet radio station in my kitchen many moons ago.
