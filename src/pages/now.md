- I'm working on two stealth design events for later in 2024, one will be in New England, the other in Portland. More on those in the coming weeks. 

- I've been working remote in Ann Arbor, MI for the first part of the year, as I'm teaching a <a href="https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/faculty/directory/ron-bronson/"></a>service design</a> course in the College of Architecture & Urban Planning. It's been interesting to scale years of learnings in iterative service delivery and teaching it to people who have learned a bit about prototyping and understand design concepts, but not a complete picture of how that works IRL.

- I'll be in my 5th season at Catlin Gabel this year. We graduated a pretty big and successful senior class year, but our core is very experience and all but one of our entries to state last year were 9th graders, so there's a lot to look forward to. Every year I've had the job was a year longer than I anticipated sticking around, the success isn't what keeps me around, it's seeing the growth in these players, especially the ones you're never expecting to turn into leaders who eventually do. I've been fortunate every year to beef up our non-conference schedule too, which serves us well coming the post-season. This is the most open year we've had since my first season, so I'm super curious to see how it all plays out. 

**Upcoming Talks**
- Feb 29 - Portland State University
- Mar 17 - Design Museum Everywhere Annual Meeting
- Apr 17 - University of Michigan 

**Design Book Club**
I've wanted to reboot a design book club in Portland, since there isn't an active one, but I don't really have the time to manage that. Thankfully, someone reached out to me about moving forward with an idea like that and so we're going to see if we can get something going into the spring or summer of this year.
