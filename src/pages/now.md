**Teaching in the Winter**
I'm in the syllabus design stages of planning to teach a course at the University of Michigan's Taubman School of Architecture and Urban Planning this January. The undergraduate course is a Service Design studio for 3rd year undergraduates in their Urban Technology BS program, which is just three years old.

Leaving the west coast for the frigid midwest at the height of winter is going to be wild, it's been 6 years since I've had to endure a winter out there, but I'm very much looking forward to being in front of a classroom and getting to talk about service design with people are unfamiliar with it, will be a great job.

Before I do that, I'm actually doing a half-day guest lecturing situation at George Fox University, in November. We're going to talk about service design there, too. Hopefully my syllabus for Michigan will be nearly done then, making drafting a lecture for this group a lot easier. My problem with talking about service design isn't what to say, but how to constrain the wide array of things I can talk about.

**Rebooting IxDA PDX**
As I mentioned previously, IxDA Portland hasn't done much in six years. I rejoined as a co-organizer earlier this year, almost solely to see if I could help reboot it. I've come to believe/find/think that chapter-based design groups like this (And AIGA Portland where I'm president of the board) are kind of becoming less appealing to people. 

There are lots of reasons for this. In any case, I've rebooted IxDA Portland as the [Service Design League](https://www.meetup.com/servicedesignleague/). I was inspired by another IxDA chapter uses a more marketable name (Orange County UX) and the decline of both the local design book club in Portland and the explicitly service design group made me think there was an opportunity.

I won't run this group, I don't really have the time. But my goal is to find a few folks who might want to steer the book club and to pair it more with AIGA events, since there's an active group of designers already existing in town. If there's enough demand, I could see lots of opportunities, but there aren't *that* many people here doing this type of work, relatively speaking.
