- I've been working remote in Ann Arbor, MI for the first part of the year, as I'm teaching a <a href="https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/faculty/directory/ron-bronson/"></a>service design</a> course in the College of Architecture & Urban Planning. It's been interesting to scale years of learnings in iterative service delivery and teaching it to people who have learned a bit about prototyping and understand design concepts, but not a complete picture of how that works IRL.

- I'll be in my 5th season at Catlin Gabel this year. We graduated a pretty big and successful senior class year, but our core is very experience and all but one of our entries to state last year were 9th graders, so there's a lot to look forward to. 

**Upcoming Talks**
- Feb 29 - Portland State University
- Mar 17 - Design Museum Everywhere Annual Meeting
- Apr 17 - University of Michigan
