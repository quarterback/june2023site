      <p>

In my personal practice, I blend discursive design with interaction architecture to critically assess the impact of technology, especially the effects of platform decay on civic life's deterioration. Recently, I've delved into the intricacies of generative AI platforms, exploring their swift integration into society and the profound policy implications that arise. <br><br><br>

I view web pages as architectural constructs, visualizing websites as interactions akin to daily person-to-person activities. This perspective has reshaped my approach to conference talks, where I now favor "Call and response" speculative design activities. These sessions encourage participants to engage with ideas that challenge our perceptions of places, policies, structures, and future possibilities.  <br><br><br>

My speculative design exhibit, <a href="https://ronbronson.mmm.page/neighbors">"A Parliament of Neighbors,"</a> was showcased at the Chimaera Art Kunsthalle in May 2023. The previous year, my exhibit "The Designer's Share of the Problem" was featured at the Pacific Northwest College of Art during the Portland Design Festival. My latest experiment was the Open Source Dating Project, which contemplates a world where findability isn't

At the core of my design philosophy is the belief that everything is design. Accepting this notion allows us to envision what we desire and chart a course to achieve it. My journey into design began with websites. I built my first website in 1994 and landed my initial internet startup role even before finishing high school. Yet, I never imagined I'd be immersed in this field for so long, let alone make a career out of it.
