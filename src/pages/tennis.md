**My tennis journey**

Tennis is only organized sport I've ever played, unless you count that one year of rec baseball or all of the skeeball championships I've won. After 4 years of high school, I joined the Air Force. During my time in the Air Force, I came back to tennis after taking two years off and really worked on my game. I joined a club and really improved, mostly for something to do. I played one year in college and thought I'd give the sport up, but it was a nice way to earn money in summers and turns out, I had a knack of building engaging tennis programs at camps that kids gravitated towards.

I've always worked in tech, but tennis wasn't far away. Early in my career, I had the chance to coach at a university where I worked. When I moved, I had no problems taking over a JV program and approached it with the same zeal, especially with lower stakes. 

After a few more summers at camp, I kind of thought I'd never coach again. Besides the occasional lesson or helping out high school programs in towns I lived, I never imagined I'd spend springs like my own coach once did.


I returned to tennis coaching after 8 years away in 2019, driven by a desire to give back to the community, learn more about Oregon, and pay tribute to my own mentor, [Mr. Van Blake](https://oralhistory.rutgers.edu/interviewees/1507-van-blake-donald). 

While I relish victories, I'm equally committed to honesty and realism with my players, motivating them to improve year after year. My favorite moments aren't really the championships, it's all the moments that lead up to the wins and losses. It's growing and getting better. 

I've written about coaching on the blog about [lineups](https://ronbronson.blot.im/tennis-ladders) & why [I keep coaching.](https://ronbronson.blot.im/why-i-keep-coaching)
