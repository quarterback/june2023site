I've coached boys & girls varsity tennis programs in three states. I've also been a collegiate assistant coach.

Analytics proliferate team sports, but tennis has been slow to adopt them widely. This is especially true at the high school level, where the resources for data gathering are scarce. I've been using video analysis in my programs for many years, but leveraging my background in technology, I've been able to integrate my passion for both into developing high-performance analysis to help players maximize their performance over the course of relatively short high school seasons. This emphasis is mostly on match planning, which helps elite junior players augment their lessons with tactics that help them strategize and win matches consistently. Coupled with my skill as a performance coach, my techniques have helped develop programs at all levels. 

I played one season of collegiate tennis at Monmouth College in Illinois, after a 4-year stint in the US Air Force. Before that, I played 4 years of high school tennis in New Jersey.
