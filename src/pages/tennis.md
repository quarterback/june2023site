Ron Bronson is entering his 5th year as head coach of the girls tennis program at Catlin Gabel School in Portland. The Eagles won the 2022 OSAA 4A/1A state title, and the Oregon 3A Championship in 2021. 

His squads are a remarkable 31-0 in conference play since 2020, and have won two team District titles. In 2023, he coached the 4A/1A Girls Doubles state champions, only the 2nd Catlin Gabel girls duo to win a doubles title (first since 1996.) In 2022, he coached a state singles finalist & state singles semi-finalist. 11 Eagles have earned All-State honors, and two players have gone on to play Division 1 athletics.

Coach Bronson was named 2022-23 4A Girls State Coach of the Year by the Oregon Athletic Coaches Association, and has been honored twice as a Regional/District Coach of the Year during his career.

Prior to Catlin Gabel, Coach Bronson was Boys Varsity Head Coach at Oregon City (OR), where the team earned OSAA All-State Academic Honors in 2019. During the pandemic, he concurrently led the boys & girls tennis program at Cheyenne Central (WY), and led the girls program to the South Regional & Conference title in 2022. While at Central, he coached two All-State selections, including a girls state champion (2nd singles) & state finalist (1st singles). 

Over a decade earlier, he started his coaching career leading tennis programs at private camps in New England, as well as one season as the men's assistant coach at Aurora University (IL). 

He later played college tennis at Monmouth College in Illinois, after four years in the US Air Force.  Ron was a 4-year letter winner at Plainfield (NJ) High School, where he was part of 3 state playoff teams and was a captain on their first boys conference championship title squad in 1997. His high school coach was 2-time New Jersey coach of the Year and Eastern Tennis Association Hall of Famer Donald Van Blake.

In 2004, he (accidentally) invented the sport of Tennis Polo[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_polo](Toccer) at Camp Awosting in Connecticut.
