*Outside of the various orgs where I participate, I've done formal (and informal) tech/design career coaching & mentorship over the years through [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/ron-bronson), Out of Office Hours, and others...I'm mostly talking on this page about an entirely different kind of coaching! Feel free to get in touch about that, though. [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ronbronson) is probably the most expedient place.*
