**Coaching philosophy** 
I meld mindset coaching, enthusiasm for the game, and integrating life lessons into my practice as a tennis coach. My passion for the sport is outweighed by my passion for seeing the evolution and growth that happens from the start of the season through the end. I've integrated analytics and advanced metrics into my coaching from the start, leveraging video analysis even in summer youth programs as a way to help players refine and improve their games. 

I excel at building programs through culture, helping players unlock their potential and taking a sport like tennis -- which isn't naturally a team sport -- and instilling a willingness among competitive athletes to care whether the last person on the ladder has as much success as the D1 prospects at the top of ladder. 

Over the years, my philosophy of humor and a passion for analytics, deep technical ability & fastidious record-keeping to build tennis programs that attracts players at all levels.

**My Tennis Story**

My coaching journey began as a player through public tennis recreation programs at a 9-year old. I watched the game on television and didn't know anyone in my family who played, which made it less daunting for me to try than other sports. 

Unbeknownst to me at the time,  I lived in a community with an extremely vibrant recreational tennis infrastructure, powered by a bevy of passionate volunteers and parents who made it possible to learn the sport from the ground up. 

In high school, I was a 4-year varsity letter winner at Plainfield (NJ) High School, during the golden era of Plainfield tennis in the 1990s. We won the school's first-ever Watchung Conference title in 1997 and made three NJSIAA state sectional tournament runs under the tutelage of two-time New Jersey State Coach of the Year & USTA Junior Tennis Federation Eastern Hall of Famer [Donald Van Blake.](https://www.easterntennishalloffame.com/2008). I'm proud to have led the effort to have our home tennis courts named after him before the conclusion of his 30-year career as head coach in 2006.

After four years in the U.S. Air Force, I played college tennis at Monmouth College in Illinois. Earlier in my career, I spent summers as tennis director at camps in the Midwest & New England. 

While tennis director at Camp Awosting in 2004, I (sort of accidentally) invented the sport of [https://toccer.com](Tennis Polo) (Toccer)
