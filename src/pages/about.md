I’ve built a career bridging the gaps between systems, services, technology, and people. By trade, I am an information architect, researcher, and service designer. I write and speak globally on <a href="https://consequencedesign.com">Consequence Design</a>, a discursive concept that examines the ways the human-computer interaction layer of technology has consequences on the everyday experiences of urban and civic life. <br><br>

Currently, I am the Head of Design at 18F, a federal digital services office aimed at improving the user experience of government, housed within the General Services Administration. My career journey has spanned consulting, local & state governments and academia. <br><br>

I've been on stage at design & tech events such as IxDA Oslo, An Event Apart, Confab, UXR Toronto, Rosenfield Civic Design, and SDN Global Conference. In 2023, I curated the Chimaera Portland Kunsthalle exhibition <em><a href="https://ronbronson.mmm.page/neighbors">A Parliament of Neighbors</em></a>, which explored ideas around borders, belonging, and community in an age of disinformation. In 2022, my participatory design project <em><a href="https://www.ronbronson.design/posts/designers-share">The Designer's Share of the Problem</a></em> was part of the Portland Design Festival. Previously, I founded Indianapolis Design Week and served as the event’s director until 2018. <br><br>

Currently, I serve as the President of the board of <a href="https://portland.aiga.org">AIGA Portland.</a> In my spare time, I coach high school tennis. I was named 4A-1A Girls Tennis Coach of the Year by the Oregon Athletic Coaches Association for 2022-23 season. 

Previously served on the <a href="https://www.portland.gov/bds/landmarks">Portland Historic Landmarks Commission.</a><br><br>
