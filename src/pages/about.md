My current role as Head of Design at 18F allows me to improve the user experience of government services. Prior to this, I worked in various sectors, helping organizations navigate the digital landscape, including local and state government entities, colleges, universities, and startups like Omnivore, where I served as Brand Director.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I've actively contributed to the design community by serving on the boards of AIGA Indianapolis and WFHB-FM, as well as on the City of Portland Historic Landmarks Commission. I've also been involved in launching Indianapolis Design Week, co-founding Future Wyoming, and establishing Aggregate as a collaborative community.

For the past few years, I've been speaking & writing about consequence design. Rather than simply creating products or services without considering the consequences, consequence design centers around understanding the potential outcomes and actively incorporating them into the design process. 

Through my personal studio, **57th Parallel**, where I host a variety of design-related activities including a community of practice, interdisciplinary collaboration, and workshops throughout the year both in the Pacific Northwest and the Baltic. 

Right now, I'm serving as President of the board of AIGA Portland and volunteer as a news anchor at KBOO-FM, as well as several groups where I volunteer including mentoring early career designers.

I've served on the boards of AIGA Indianapolis, WFHB-FM (a community radio station in Indiana) and was appointed to serve on the City of Portland Historic Landmarks Commission. In 2017, I launched Indianapolis Design Week, was co-founder and policy director at Future Wyoming (a student-founded think tank), and launched Aggregate (a collaborate community). 

Outside of design, I've spent more than half my life involved with tennis. After a scholastic & collegiate playing career, I've enjoyed coaching. I've coached men's college tennis, as well as boys & girls high school teams in three states and at private camps in New England.
