I've been trying to diminish my Twitter usage for weeks anyway, and I've mostly done it. But I was still holding out hope that we could manage to operate under the new conditions, at least until a truly better alternative emerged. Unfortunately, that's not the case and it's time to say goodbye for good.

Without a doubt, Twitter changed my life more than any other social media platform besides AOL or something. Twitter allowed me to benefit from the timing and growth of Web 2.0 to essentially reinvent myself multiple times, to develop a global network full of strangers that in many cases became extremely close friends, colleagues, and acquaintances. I've bought an entire bookshelf of books thanks to Twitter recommendations, and I'll miss the good times. 

I always knew it was bad and the bad eventually became worse. In every case, it was the people that made it what it was and what it remains. But there's nothing left for me there worth fighting for. It's not about anyone's market cap at this point, it's simply about participating in an environment that doesn't really serve the purpose it once did for me.

I'm all over the web still, but you can mostly find my [Tweet-like thoughts on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@ronbronson) for right now. 

Maybe I'll finally start blogging for real.
