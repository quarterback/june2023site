Back in 2016, I made a booklist of interesting books I'd read over the years that were worth sharing, because at that time there was were way fewer people doing "teach-ins" on twitter and so forth. The list used to live on Goodreads, but I deleted that account and never remade it. 

Thankfully, Storygraph preserved the list and I added new books to it. I'm too lazy to add the new books, [but you can track the whole list here on Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/tags/6d2f1d7e-a325-4f0a-8bf6-b7cc388ef8b0).

_Programming note, Forestry does not support full-post sharing RSS natively, and with it being phased out this month, I'm likely to look for a different solution for GUI blogging. This site does support blogging in a code editor and that's fine -- these are just markdown files -- but I kind of prefer a CMS interface for whatever reason._
